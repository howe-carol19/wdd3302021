<h2> The script Tag </h2>
    <p> In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags. </p>
    <p> A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for. For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.</p>
    
<h2>Head or Body </h2>
    <p> You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document. Scripts can be placed in the body, or in the head section of an HTML page, or in both.</p>
    
<h2> External and Internal Script </h2>
    <p>It separates HTML and code. It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain. Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads</p>
    <p>With a full URL (a full web address). With a file path (like /js/). Without any path</p>
    
<h2> Arguments vs Paremeters </h2>
    <p> Arguments and parameters are often referred to interchangeably. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this tutorial, we will make a distinction. In most standards, parameters (or formal parameters) are what’s given in the function declaration, and arguments (or actual parameters) are what’s passed to the function.</p>
